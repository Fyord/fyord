Light-weight framework designed to embrace core competencies

It's designed to take advantage of everything you love about web development without the need to learn a considerable amount of new framework-specific knowledge, letting you focus your time on skills that transfer.

We're building Fyord to be easy to test and debug. It's fast and secure by default. It's also minimal in learning curve, boilerplate, and friction.

Try it and let us know what you think!

Ensure you have [npm/node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and run these commands in your terminal:
